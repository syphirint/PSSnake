# PSSnake

A snake game implemented (although neither well nor efficiently) in Powershell without using fancy graphic modes.

## Description

Just wanted to create a snake game without any fancy graphic modes. Just ASCII* characters.

*Extended ASCII

## Installation

Well, not exactly "installation".

### You can:

Clone the repository with:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/syphirint/PSSnake
```
### Or
Just download the `PSSnake.ps1` alone.
### Or
Create a file in your system and `Ctrl-C`-`Ctrl-V` the code.

**Your choice.**

## Usage

For best experience use a Command Prompt (`cmd`) window and not Powershell console.

```
> powershell          # invoke powershell within cmd
> cd .\Desktop        # assuming that the file is on your Desktop
> .\PSSnake.ps1       # run the game
```
