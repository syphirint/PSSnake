# PSSnake

A snake game implemented in Powershell without graphic mode.

## Description

*Extended ASCII

## Installation

Well, not exactly "installation".

### You can:

Clone the repository with:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/syphirint/PSSnake
```
### Or
Just download the `PSSnake.ps1` alone.
### Or
Create a file in your system and `Ctrl-C`-`Ctrl-V` the code.
Be careful when copying the code, as it needs to be encoded in UCS-2 BE BOM. Otherwise, the visuals might be compromised.

**Your choice.**

## Usage

Use Command Prompt (`cmd`) or Powershell Console.

### Command Prompt
```
> powershell          # invoke powershell within cmd
> cd .\Desktop        # assuming that the file is on your Desktop
> .\PSSnake.ps1       # run the game
```
### Powershell Console
```
> cd .\Desktop        # assuming that the file is on your Desktop
> .\PSSnake.ps1       # run the game
```
